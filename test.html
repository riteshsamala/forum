There are two things that we need:
<ol>
<li>An author creates a new thread identified by problem name,
author name, and section name.  The thread is titled by (at least) 
the problem name.  
The server may need to create a new forum account for the
author, if it does not exist.
It might be nice if the thread contains an
initial post consisting of the problem text?

<p>The URL would contain: problem name, user (author) name, section name, and 
initial post text.  The method would be HTTP POST since the text may
be long.  

<li>A user is logged into the forum and directed to an existing thread.
The URL would contain the user name, section name, problem name,
and problem author name. 
The server may need to create a new forum account for the
user, if it does not exist.

</ol>

Currently, this only works for custom problems.  We will worry about
published problems later.
